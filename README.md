- Language: JavaScript / TypeScript

- Styling: Tailwind CSS

- Animation: Framer Motion

## Features

- Instant animation on page load
 
- Animation re-triggerable via CSS or state key

- No dynamic imports (import())

- No Lottie or Lottie-like libraries

- Fast performance using lightweight Framer Motion variants

- Clean and simple folder structure

## AI Usage

### AI tools like ChatGPT and/or Google Gemini were used to:

- Speed up creation of Framer Motion variants
- Help debug timing/sequence issues
- Draft this README.md

All logic, animation fine-tuning, and implementation were written manually.
